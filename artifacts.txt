First create a empty folder in your Project path. 

Then name it with 'artifacts'.

After you run that code in your Jupyter Notebook, 


import pickle 

pickle.dump(new_df, open('artificats/movie_list.pkl', 'wb'))
pickle.dump(similarity, open('artificats/similarity.pkl', 'wb'))


There will be 2 model in that 'artifacts' folder. 

I couldn't upload it because the size was too large.

Sry for my bad.
